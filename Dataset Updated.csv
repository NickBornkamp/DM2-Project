eBay,Customer Service Representative,0,easy job but company is a mess..,"1. i love having the ability to work remotely. 

2. vacation is accrued during the time you are working and starts accruing during day 1 of employment.

3. management is not overbearing and is helpful when it comes to certain life situations such as power outages, internet outages, etc.

4. i have not experienced it myself yet, but it does seem that there is a large amount of career opportunities. you receive emails when a position has opened up and are invited to apply. they also give you an opportunity to do a trial period with a certain position to see if that is the job you want to transfer to or if it may not be your cup of tea.","1. pay is not what was expected nor what was told to me during interview process. i was told that raises would increase every 6 months as you grow your tenure. few months in, i was then told that i would not see a raise for a few years or until i reach a certain skill/department (premium services) considering i was already brought in at the maximum rate which is not what was told to me. 

2. during the interview and training process, i was told that the company offers flexible scheduling to help work around your life/work schedule. when i asked about changing my schedule due to my husband's schedule changing which resulted in either of us not being able to pick up our 1 year old from daycare, i was told no and that i was hired for that specific time slot and that i cannot change my schedule at all under any circumstances. that rubbed me the wrong way.

3. when it comes to seeking help everything seems all over the place. your options are looking up articles, contacting another department which is an entire issue in itself, or reaching out to management which... is almost never there. if they are there, they tell you to reach out via help line which sometimes does not provide much help. 

4. transfers. when it comes to transferring to different departments it is a complete nightmare!! you can only do a warm transfer and every single time i get a customer that needs to be transferred to the correct department, the representative on the other end pretends that they are going to take the call then will disconnect. every single time!!! it is extremely frustrating. then the so called resolution is to submit a transfer tracker documentation about the representative who disconnected but nothing seems to be done about it. i have made so many submissions that i could write a 5 page essay. now, they say you can cold transfer after being disconnected with an agent twice but that should not be the case.

5. 85% of the time i truly do not even understand what i am doing or supposed to do when it comes to helping some customers. you are very limited on what you can do which angers many of the customers. you are here to guide customers through the website and tell them to do it on their own.

6. my vacation was used without my knowledge or consent. i came across a day where i was very sick and was going in to use some of the vacation that i accrued only to find out that it was already used. i had a couple cases where my internet provider was doing maintenance for our neighborhood and connection would go in and out. i gave management a heads up days before about it but still attempted to work. during the timeframe where the internet was out for a few hours it seems that they input vacation hours during that time but never told me. so i was a bit frustrated when i went to go use it when i actually needed it and there was none to use.

now, i understand companies are not perfect and the call center jobs are not the greatest and will have its ups and downs. i have previously worked as a call center representative for at&t and i had an absolute terrible time with at&t. but i hate to say it, i would rather go back and deal with at&t than ebay.",3

eBay,Strategy Analyst,0,nope,its a global company and has name recognition,"its going no where. lack of direction and follow through, a dinosaur",1
eBay,Customer Service Representative,0,diversity in upper management is severly lacking and is bothersome,"benefits start from day one and are pretty good.
lots of remote work available.
global company.","customer service is the only diverse section of this company. the upper managment and above is 98% white, which bothers me, because they advertise they are so diverse, but there are not any people of color, that i have seen in supervisor positions, management positions and definitely none in the executive positions. this is problematic for me, when they encourage you and tell you that you can pretty much move around and up within the company. it is discouraging and does not seem true, when i see maybe one person of color in any sort of ""leader"" position.

metrics: their metrics method makes no sense and is not fair. when you are hired into their customer service department, training is in three phases: you are trained in buy, then you go on live for a month or two, then you are trained in selling, and lastly m2m (which is for like disputes and other issues). working in the buy department is equivalent to being a receptionist for a company..... you get all of the calls! if a customer calls in and does not specify a department, or presses 0, they will be routed to the buy department. if you are only trained in buy, you have to transfer all of the other calls. transferring customers negatively affects your metrics. your metrics are factored into your bonuses. so it is not fair for employees who are only trained in buy because that department gets all calls, and has to transfer quite often.

survey's!!!: surveys are not fair (i have great survey results, but it is still not fair) because when a customer calls and has issues with the company (which the most common issue is how hard it is to reach a representative, because ebay tries to discourage customers from calling because they do not have enough employees to handle the volume of calls that would come if they published their phone number). so if a customer has an issue with ebay as a company, and not the actual representative that helps them, the only opportunity they have to express their dissatifaction is when they are offered the opportunity to take a survey after thier interaction with the representative that helped them. the survey affects the representative, which is unfair because that customer is complaining about the company and not the representative. this also affects your bonuses and ultimately your pay (increases). 

so those three things can be very frustrating and can be very discouraging.

ebay is a cool company to work for in theory, but if you have spent years working in customer service, you are trained to help customers, and that helping customers is what matters most! however, here at ebay i am not really sure what their goal is with customers..... you are not allowed to use certain words (such as ""i apologize"",), you are not allowed to ask the customer if they need any further assistance (which if they do, they end up calling back and that too negatively affects your metrics lol). 

and lastly (but definitely not least), the pay could be much better. they advertise about their benefits being so great, but the pay is not great. they basically start you out at around $20.50-$22 hourly, which honestly, in todays economy is not ""good"". they may consider it ""fair"" but i would rather they brag about great pay than great benefits, or how about just being ""great"" on both. 

my main cons would be the lack of diversity in upper management (this is a huge deal to me, because i feel like there is a glass ceiling with how far i can go, being a person of color), and the pay (which does without explaining).",3

eBay,Online Seller,0,ebay online seller,"flexibility: one of the most significant advantages of being an ebay online seller is the flexibility it offers. you can set your own hours and work from anywhere with an internet connection. this is particularly attractive for those who need to balance work with other responsibilities or have irregular schedules. low start-up costs: starting an ebay selling business typically requires minimal upfront investment. you can often use items you already own or source products inexpensively to get started. wide customer reach: ebay is a global platform with millions of users, which means you have access to a vast customer base. this can help you reach a broader audience than you might with a traditional brick-and-mortar store. profit potential: depending on what you sell and how well you market your products, there is potential for a good income. some sellers have turned their ebay businesses into full-time careers. no boss: as a self-employed ebay seller, you are your own boss. you make decisions about what to sell, how to price items, and how to manage your business.","competition: ebay is a highly competitive marketplace. many other sellers are offering similar products, which can make it challenging to stand out and attract customers. price wars and undercutting are common. fees: ebay charges various fees, including listing fees, final value fees, and payment processing fees. these fees can eat into your profits, especially if you have a high volume of sales. shipping and handling: managing shipping, packing, and customer service can be time-consuming and, at times, frustrating. dealing with lost or damaged packages, returns, and customer inquiries can be a significant part of the job. marketplace changes: ebay frequently updates its policies and algorithms, which can have a significant impact on your business. these changes can be challenging to adapt to, and they may affect your sales and visibility. income variability: your income as an ebay seller can be inconsistent. sales may fluctuate, and it can take time to build a reliable customer base. this variability can make budgeting and financial planning more difficult. taxes and legal obligations: as a self-employed individual, you will need to manage your taxes and comply with local, state, and federal regulations. this includes reporting your income and potentially collecting and remitting sales tax.",4

(senior director, global supply enablement & success) anymore - when she first took over she was visible, she asks for reports that make no sense for the role i do. she has literally hired and fired people to get her friends from expedia jobs i had a call with a new hire, who is a level 28 - she asked me what was fba and a 3pl - quite alarming and surely this hire should of been asked these questions in an interview - and shows what happens when you hire from the wrong background new hire said they will not make changes for 18 months, which again is ridiculous, seems like they want to cash in as much of their salary as possible before they leave. really hope ashish c looks into reversing and replacing the senior management especially those from expedia or no e-commerce background markets are not working together globally from a bd perspective, its been a year since these changes have been made and nothing has changed really - people in other markets feel the same. there is a fear more layoffs are coming as budgets are being squeezed across teams so please be transparent if that is the case.",3

it is a bad place for development, too. they have a bunch of proprietary technologies they use and learning those is a gigantic waste of time. first, you are learning to use badly written code, poorly designed user interfaces, and tools sets that can only be described as antediluvian. it is madness. the technologies you are learning to work with are used by no other company in the world because it is proprietary. when i was there they had their own version of cloud services for internal use. it was terrible and you need to be using an industry standard platform like aws or azure if you want career growth outside ebay.

they rave about their amazing benefits, when i have had much much better benefits at every other company i have worked for. i have never paid so much for dr visits in my life. with insurance. 

they do not care about their employees, unless you are management and allow no sick leave without dipping into your paid time off. if you do not have enough- they will put that in the negative before they just let you be sick, so your time away from work is minimal. colleagues have had to miss their own fathers funeral due to this. otherwise they would have lost their job.

eBay,Product Manager,1,they do not care about you.,"you will get to work with some very intelligent people at ebay, pay is competitive, benefits are great.","buckle up because there are so many cons'
1. management does not care about you. you are a work horse for them and will continue to put pressure unless you set limits. 
2. no clear path for advancement.  literally none. you can ask your manager about this in every 1:1, that is if you are lucky enough to have the same manager for more than 6 months (see #3), but you will have to be the squeaky wheel to get any kind of traction on a promotion. 
3. constant restructuring and turnover. this creates a pretty tense work environment when you have to shift your roadmap and working style ever ~6 months because people either leave or there is another 'reorg'. 
4. roadmap planning is different every year'probably again because of #3, and it is always rushed. you will be expected to start work on q1 projects and not have a finalized roadmap until q1 has already started.  this already sets up up for failure and causes you to miss deadlines.
5. bigger projects tend to lack end to end vision.  mainly because the planning process is so rushed that design/product/etc is never given enough time to fully explore all the use cases which leads to missing use cases and broken features'and ultimately upset end users.",1

if you are a blue badge full time, they will help pay for schooling.
plenty of resources that i have never seen offered at a job before.","on the flip side if you are looking into making a career out of amazon and moving up that can happen! however, after you become a tier 4, your work life balance will be stripped from you depending on what your shift is. terrible hours, working 13 hours a day 3-4 times a week. 5am-6pm or 5pm-6am are the currently shift times if you would like to become a manager. it did not used to be like this, so i have given up on my goal to become a manager because the currently schedule is not great in my opinion.
this will causes managers to quit and not be able to talk to all amazonians which leads to connection scores going down along with morale for team.

the pay is average, 
i think amazon should pay tier 1 aas more. 
tier 3's should be paid more, and managers should be paid more.

competitive compensation: amazon typically offers competitive wages and benefits packages, including health insurance, retirement plans, and employee discounts.

learning experience: the role of a process assistant involves exposure to various aspects of warehouse operations, providing valuable experience in logistics, inventory management, and process optimization.

team environment: working as part of a team fosters collaboration, allowing for shared goals and mutual support among colleagues.

operational impact: as a process assistant, you have the opportunity to make a tangible impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of warehouse operations, contributing to overall success.","physical demands: warehouse work can be physically demanding, requiring prolonged periods of standing, lifting heavy objects, and working in varying temperatures.

fast-paced environment: the nature of amazon's operations often entails a fast-paced work environment with strict productivity targets, which may be stressful for some individuals.

irregular hours: shift work and overtime may be required, including nights, weekends, and holidays, which can disrupt work-life balance for some employees.

safety risks: working in a warehouse environment poses inherent safety risks, such as potential hazards from heavy machinery, moving equipment, and high shelves.

high expectations: amazon maintains high standards for performance and efficiency, which may lead to pressure to meet strict productivity goals and metrics on a consistent basis.",4

on another note, the company feels quite competitive and not as welcoming as some smaller companies i have worked at before. this is a symptom of the size of the company, but i still think there are ways to make it better despite the company's large size.

there is also a surprising degree of autonomy in some senses, but it also means that everything is your job - everything. this can even include doing financial analysis for potential solutions and having to make a business case,

the downside is that there is also a finger pointing culture. so you are responsible for everything (much of which you likely never did before, let alone within their 'peculiar' processes), and if something goes awry, i have had a manager throw me under the bus for overlooking something.

Amazon,Executive Assistant,1,only good for the resume,"the pay is decent, but you have to stay at least 4 years to see the entire payout (and internally, it is a running joke that 1 amazon year is equivalent to 3 years at any other company). this position only looks good on your resume if you are supporting a vp or above. other companies laugh when they find out you were only supporting a couple of directors.","ea’s show their true colors after the interview, and they are miserable. no work life balance. colleagues treat you as if you are their personal assistant. you need a lot of backbone and to set strict boundaries from the beginning, however, tread lightly. it is not uncommon for ea’s to be working past 6pm on weekdays, and for a couple hours on sunday to get prepped for the week ahead. changes happen all hours of the night. this is a highly stressful position, and you are always working to stay afloat each week. there is no strategic planning or forward thinking. also be prepared to always be available - even during your pto. it is near impossible to catch up if you truly disconnect for more than a day or two.",2

the work environment is reminiscent of a battle of a personalities, resembling a jungle where it is either kill or be killed. the company now thrives on fake personalities and pseudo experts, seemingly overloaded with career worriers from india and eu. the leadership, clearly out of their depth since the company doubled during covid, appears to have no clue about the chaos that ensued.

navigating through the organization feels like a constant clash of egos, with individuals meticulously checking your level before deciding whether they want to engage with you. at level 8, some people seem to be part of a cult, with a few having previously run private prisons before joining the company. your manager becomes your ticket to promotion, deciding which lamb will go to the slaughterhouse.

reporting a harassing manager with a genuine reason seems futile, as the hr department is seemingly impotent, adhering to a company legal team policy of not taking any prisoners. endless hours are spent on document creation, only to be followed by harsh criticism of ideas based on trivial aspects like format and font.

a shocking revelation is that 60 percent of the projects my organization pursued were unnecessary, undertaken merely to portray the illusion that the organization was thriving. amazon is no longer the company you would want to work for.

i have witnessed people screaming at each other in meetings, witnessed women breaking down due to brutal feedback from fellow women, all while hr turns a blind eye to resolving any issues. pay raises seem to depend on imaginary superpowers, but in reality, your manager holds the real super power to make or break it.

during my tenure, i have seen colleagues admitted to psychiatric care because they could not endure the toxicity any longer. the compensation, though generous, becomes a form of stockholm syndrome, trapping employees in a life they cannot leave behind. expect to take calls on the weekend and reply to emails from peers across the globe at odd hours, leading to a detrimental impact on mental health.

i will never consider returning to amazon after the traumatic experiences i endured. a close friend and wounded veteran was heartlessly fired due to ptsd, unable to meet unrealistic deadlines. in this cutthroat environment, one is compelled to bring the best metaphorical knife and learn how to navigate the jungle by any means necessary.",2

- solid company values: many core startup culture values were pioneered by facebook.

- consistent quality co-workers

- impact: opportunity to work on important problems and make a difference.

- machine learning strength: the company has a great position in ai, with strong talent and the positioning of supporting openness.","- past its peak: driven my many factors, such as overall maturity of the business, its weak strategic position (vs. competitors), low brand value (given criticisms of social media, and the company in particular). regulatory pressure. 

- strategic weakness: the company has both made strategic errors (e.g. metaverse), and not been consistent in its strategy (you cannot accomplish anything it you do not stick to some strategy, and changing quickly has a negative effect on organizational memory). 

- big company syndrome: due to factors such as those listed above, meta suffers from the many downsides of large companies, such as bureaucracy, politics, and as a result has a hard time creating new quality products, or even improving current products. 

- straying from values: meta has drifted from practicing its core values and even eliminated some (transparency), 

- perverse incentives: as a result of maturity (esp. because it is hard to do anything) and lax values, there are often perverse incentives to succeed by playing internal corporate games that are often arbitrary, or even detrimental to the company. at the same time, the legacy of the company's culture of freedom results in a level of chaos. this can result in an environment that is both arbitrary and unpredictable

Meta,Software Engineer,0,landslide win over google for career growth,"i just left google and joined facebook, and felt so much happier. the reasons are:

1. the real impact
at google i joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product i was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually does not matter at all. just for that module, i had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. i admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that does not matter is just a waste of my life.

in facebook things just move so much faster. there are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. just during training (boot camp) weeks, i had tasks to change very important part of facebook's core code, and the second day after i check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. as a software engineer i cannot recall a moment i felt better for my job.

then i joined a team that is extremely important to facebook's revenue. a mistake in the code i changed could cause facebook million dollar a day. however facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. if i make a coding mistake in my team in google it might cost google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict i could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. but in facebook that is all possible.

2. the organizational structure
google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. my boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. i do not quite like the office decoration style. a little bit stressful and factory like.
2. the compensation is better than google but not as good as other smaller companies.

-employees have no respect for leadership and keep demanding more and more when it comes to what they think they deserve in terms of perks and benefits (despite having one of the best packages in the world). on the flip side, leadership also gives in way too easily to many employees absurd political demands. the ""days of learning"" are widely regarded as jokes and opportunities to take the day off. one i saw an admin post a crying selfie on workplace because zuck announced an update to their pay structure (not a decrease). weird, inappropriate behavior by employees.

Meta,Marketing Manager,1,severe leadership failures in reality labs marketing at meta,"working at meta's reality labs marketing department offers exposure to some truly talented individuals and the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge ar/vr technology. this aspect of the job is genuinely exciting and provides a great learning opportunity for anyone passionate about the future of tech. comp, benefits and perks are great.","unfortunately, the experience is significantly marred by poor leadership and senior management. there is a noticeable lack of solid direction or a coherent point of view, which makes strategic planning and execution very challenging. no one wants to make a decision here. major group think issues largely due to poor leadership pov. 

the approach to decision-making is not data-driven, often seeming haphazard or impulsive. this ""shooting from the hip"" style contributes to a sense of uncertainty and inefficiency within the team.
a significant concern is the inability of leadership to make decisive and timely decisions. this indecisiveness not only hampers progress but also contributes to a frustrating work environment.

there is a widespread (justifiable) lack of respect for the marketing leadership of reality labs across various departments, from marketing, strategy, and creative. i think about 80% of the colleagues have openly voiced their concerns. it is actually alarming. this lack of respect is alarming and raises questions about the sustainability of current leadership. i never worked somewhere where it is more obvious and openly out there that the leadership is naf. 

the choice to collaborate with bbdo as an agency partner has been a controversial move, casting doubts on the upper management's decision-making capabilities—and is emblematic of the leadership's misjudgments and disconnect from industry standards.

the overarching issue seems to be a disconnect between the reality labs org and the practical realities of the market and our audience. it is concerning how out of touch the leadership appears, prompting serious questions about the meta's marketing direction and vision for reality labs.",3

Meta,Researcher,0,toxic culture obliterates any upside,"- opportunity to work on innovative future-facing tech 

- fair pay and amazing benefits

- a lot of great, bright people - only a few will be pleasant to work with as well because of the corporate culture (see cons) 

- learning opportunities with education and conference benefits (though these seem to have been cut in lieu of ""efficiency"")

- surpassed expectations for work-life balance. though, admittedly, this wholly self-controlled. but, if you want it, you can have it.","- lack of trust - among the people you work with and upwards towards leadership 

- lack of vision - typically product evolution includes both a business and a user perspective. here you might get ""[name] says we need to ______"" or ""we already promised [name] to do ________"" without a lot of rationale or data to support anything. there was *one* business leader that explicitly called out this use of their name and said it was not an acceptable excuse to developing product in undesirable ways. most leaders will relish in their ""influence"" at the expense of efficient, human-centered product development

- managers, if you have one, are generally useless but protected by the managers above them. all are incentivized by growing their teams, regardless of if it makes sense for the business. 

- news and company perceptions can weigh heavily on you 

- prides itself on operating as a startup still, but it is nearly impossible at meta's scale to operate like this. siloing and duplicative efforts of people desperate to prove their impact are the norm. 

- likability is a currency for success. paradoxically, the performance system encourages a 'dog eat dog' environment of overachieving ics riddled with fear and insecurity as they try to prove why they are better than everybody around them thereby killing any chance of community. note, it is not really the ics fault this fear-culture flourishes. no matter what the company states, there is a performance curve - and no matter how amazing the talent, a certain percent of people will have to fall below the line as not meeting expectations and getting performance plans to shove them out the door and meet quotas 

- researchers can expect an expectation matrix of about 1200 bullet points and 5 different job descriptions in one. many managers are not shy about saying they use these bullet points like a checklist to figure out where you are lacking. (a tangential aside - while your performance success is highly contingent upon your ability to influence, no other functions will have performance matrixes that require them to work effectively with research) 

- lack of follow through and commitment to employee experience and well-being. you will be asked to provide feedback on the company, re-assured of why you are so important to the company, etc. but 1) feedback is rarely acted on (though you will have to participate in biannual ideations for leadership so they can solve their own problems - and after you have wasted time on that, nothing will change and you will do it again in 6 months) and 2) when the tides turn, you will realize your input, feedback and value are essentially null and they will not hesitate to cut the cog out of the machine. it is business. and they will likely provide enough threat (additional employee cuts or harsh policies) or incentive (extra bonuses) to make everybody else forget about that time they threw their employees under the bus.",1

Meta,Production Engineer,0,"not the worst, but that is a low bar","working at global scale, meta has to solve some unique problems few other companies have the opportunity to see. meta will often be at the forefront of new technology, or sometimes is creating that new technology, for solving problems. smaller companies often have to settle for commercial off-the-shelf products that half-work or do not actually properly work, but meta can do it properly. your managers will most likely care about you and do their best to support you in whatever you need. base pay is probably a bit lower than other similar companies, but overall benefits are incredibly hard to beat.","upper management does not care about you at all. your immediate managers do, their managers probably do, beyond that it is uncertain, and by the time you get to the vp level they do not care about the individual person. diversity support is a joke, you are supported as long as you fit one of these very specific predefined silicon valley molds otherwise you get support for what fits in that rather small space. talking about what is wrong is strongly discouraged, there is even a policy that people have fallen afoul of just for criticizing that same policy's impact on discussions about how to improve life at the company! career progression is less about what you actually do and more about how much a bunch of people think you do. i have done some huge things, well-received by people and still talked about today as a good example of a company-wide high-impact project but got a bad rating, and i have very recently had a year where i did basically nothing all year but made a bunch of upper managers happy and got a great rating. the way multiple layoffs have been handled has left us not knowing whether it is even worth working hard for a great rating anymore since we have seen high performers fired and low performers safe. at first layoffs were held dishonestly, but then subsequent layoffs were held in possibly one of the worst ways to respond to those criticisms.",2

Apple,Software Engineer,0,it is very good,"- working on cutting-edge technology. apple is known for innovative products and pushing the boundaries of technology. engineers get to develop new and exciting technologies.

- strong work culture and benefits. apple is known for having a great company culture with healthy work-life balance, generous benefits, and perks like free snacks and devices. 

- career growth opportunities. as a large and successful company, apple offers plenty of room for advancement as new projects and teams are constantly being created.

- product-focused work. engineers work directly on apple's flagship consumer products like the iphone, ipad, mac, etc. rather than more mundane backend systems.","- high expectations and pressure to perform. apple is known for perfectionism and demanding high quality. this can add stress.

- secrecy and ndas. much of apple's future product plans are confidential. this limits what engineers can share about their work externally. 

- bureaucracy of a large company. more red tape and process compared to a startup. projects take longer to complete.

- competitive hiring. very difficult to land a job at apple due to high number of applicants for each opening.

- less flexibility andremote work. apple's culture focuses heavily on collaboration in physical offices, limiting remote work possibilities.

- potentially lower pay compared to top tech companies given current compensation structure.

overall, apple provides a unique experience for engineers to work on cutting-edge consumer technologies, but also comes with expectations of discretion, bureaucracy, and less flexibility than some other companies.",5

collaborative environment: the company values collaboration, allowing you to work with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering growth and learning.

competitive benefits: apple provides comprehensive benefits and perks, ensuring that employees feel valued and supported in their roles.","fast-paced environment: the fast-paced nature of the work can be demanding and may require long hours at times to meet deadlines.
high expectations: with apple's reputation for excellence, there can be high expectations for performance, which may lead to pressure to deliver consistently exceptional results.
limited work-life balance: while efforts are made to accommodate work-life balance, the demanding nature of the job may sometimes make it challenging to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life.
competitive environment: the competitive nature of the tech industry and apple's high standards may create a challenging environment where employees need to constantly strive for excellence.
limited autonomy: some employees may find that the company's strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork leaves limited room for individual autonomy in decision-making.",5

before covid we had a much better job and help. since covid they have continually used their employees to make up for whatever “bonuses” they gave us. there is never a time where you are told what good you are doing. you are only constantly being told what is wrong. they give very unrealistic goals. expect to walk 20 miles a day. expect for your boss to cut corners in any way possible. expect to be extremely over worked. drive ups are up to 300 a day and that does not include the 100 who come to the desk to pick up. 
if your team does great then they will only get their payroll cut because they know they can get by on minimal workers doing the job of many. 
if you are there for part time and are a student or just making extra money then only give them the minimum required. your next will not get you a raise or accolades.

as far as management, they will make snide remarks as they walk past you. they will belittle you in the moment and try to place blame. some days you feel like you are rushing to get things done, only to be asked why something else was not finished. it is fairly disheartening for someone who considers themselves a hard worker.

Target,Closing Expert,0,realistic review,you might get to work with some good coworkers,"at my particular store most of the management staff (store director and team leads) were not good. even the one or two overall good tl's had some bad moments. the management staff would overwork me, give me more work (sometimes their work) to do without any pay raise or recognition. when i have tried to bring up concerns, nothing came about it so i stopped bringing them up because it became a situation of why even bother when nothing is going to come of it, why waste my time. i had one tl that would try to find things to blame me for even though i did nothing wrong and she just did not like me. another tl rolled one of the revolving shelves into me and did not really care since the ladder that was in the aisle would eventually stop the shelf that he was moving in my direction really fast. a multitude of tl's would pass off duties to myself and others on top of what we already had to do while they did nothing but sit in the office even though they are not supposed to be sitting in the office most of the time. the store director would rarely schedule enough workers and then complain about things not getting done. he would also not approve any time off or availability change requests and even when it was promised they would give me an availability arrangement that would benefit both of us it was never out into effect. i never would get weekends off, not even once a month or once every two months. i kept getting promised a promotion but it never came and during the development phase as they would call it, they just loved to give me more responsibility, stuff that was more tl related but not pay me as a tl or give me the tl title. communication between the management staff was not good. they do not communicate well to each other and if they do communicate things to others it is no guarantee they will listen or respect it. one tl kept pushing me to be more of a voice with the other tl's, show them i could lead and help plan things out for the shift but when i would try they would not listen, say i am butting in, in things that are not my business, exclude me from things which was frustrating because i was trying to do what i was asked to do by one of the tl's. basically the store runs on the ones who slack off but are like a teacher's pet and try to brown nose their way into things, and use their loudness to cover things up, get the praise and promotion. the ones who do well, work hard and have the stats to show it get punished. there was a coworker who started to get developed into a tl after myself, and even though i had the stats to back me up on my hard work and was always willing to learn and grow and such, the tl's and store director babied this guy and let him learn all these new things (that he was not doing well at) while i got stuck with doing the things i already knew how to do because they could not trust him well enough to do the things i knew.",1

they break the ada americans with disabilities act. 
they never informed me that i had to submit proof that my child has a disability which i would have happily provided. did not know that til today

bonuses are tied to your department's performance.","target keeps coming up with new features for fulfillment, meant to make it appear less busy than it is. there are more items in batches, meaning you have to pick more items with the same amount of time given.

payroll is tight and the department is always understaffed with the understanding that every other department is going to jump in to help instead of scheduling more fulfillment team members.

as a result these departments, which are already understaffed as well, cannot complete their workload. this leaves fulfillment team members to have to dig through pallets, you-boats, and repacks to find the items in their orders. since yes, you still have to consider inf metrics, meaning the amount of items you cancel.",2

- stated in job description that exposure to machine learning/engineers: not true at all, unless you mean in the most peripheral way possible. tldr: the skills gained as a annotator or lead will not serve you in any other company as they are so specific to your workflow
pto is a joke: 2 weeks vacation. whether you are there 1 day or 15 years. it never increases unless you get to salaried position, and even they rarely took time because there was always some frantic push or deadline to be reached.

Tesla,Engineering Technician II,0,extremely valuable place to start your career,"mobility
-direct mobility (level i-> level ii) is a total mixed bag that depends on opportunities to show your skills and the quality of your direct management.
- ""diagonal"" mobility is fantastic. if you can learn some basic skills that are relevant to positions, and solve some problems, then you can take a path like production associate->process technician->engineering technician->engineer, and although that is the road less-travelled people do it here often enough.
compensation
again, mixed bag. completely depends on your dept, level, management, and company goals. but there tends to be an annual or bi-annual bonus that can be taken as stock, stock-options, or cash. there is also espp which is functionally a stock savings account with 15% incentives. free therapy. healthcare is phenomenal.
there is some perks tesla occasionally has with the local things from uber to sport ticket discounts, too. the benefit package really is a part of your pay
management
-if you have a great manager then you are going to succeed here. people are rated on the social metric of not being unbearable to be around and hr takes complaints seriously if you know how to present them.
diversity
-super diverse place. i have worked for many people who fall into categories of lgbtq, poc, women, and migrants. tesla is very skills-forward and any walk of life can have a successful career here (myself included)","mobility
-mobility, in the leveling sense, can be downright insulting at the basic technician, material handling, or production associate level. i had lead job offers in hand and a supervisor still did not give me a review that indicated moving from level i to level ii. it was not until my 3rd mobility promotion that i finally saw a level-up, and it was kind of ridiculous.
compensation
- the bonuses are received annually if you are meeting performance goals but the money from those bonuses typically pays out over multiple years. so you will just miss out if you are buckled into tesla for the foreseeable future. non-technical hourly rates had to catch up to the industry but they largely have.
management
-managers just have a crazy amount of power over you and-depending on the department- minimal oversight. this can leave you stuck. to make career moves i felt the need to wait until some managers were on extended leave so i could exit a department where i was not growing. (told directly i would be held as long as allowable if offered a role elsewhere in tesla).
culture&values
-another mixed bag. lots of young passionate very smart folks. lots of people i just do not like. but sometimes safety is a risk on the factory floor if you do not have your head on a swivel. and sometimes innovation is emphasized to the point of wasted energy on changes that provide limited or non-benefit so people have it on their review reports.
senior management
-makes me nervous to see them because it is pretty rare. not typically great news. the higher up i go, the more i see that these guys are just super busy. but still, you do not get the sense that they understand the process or workflow all the time
work/life balance
-it depends massively on company goals and where you work. in general it is an intense place to work and you can really mess up your career with attendance, early-on. however, once you have proven yourself, you can get away with a little more. you always have to meet the metrics, though.",4

Tesla,Automotive Service Advisor,0,20 managers in 3.5 years. let that sink in...,"the technology - this job will keep you sharp. you must be on your a-game when working with a product that is leading the way in a tech savvy environment. the product is stellar, the work environment changes keeps you on your feet, the job is so past paced and changes so often that you are constantly learning and figuring out new issues and always adapting to new concepts and environments.

the people - as customer service representatives, you definitely deal with the occasional sh*thead but the majority of the customers are really cool. they all have different backgrounds and come from a very different past. tons of tech industry guys, car dorks, and all around eco-friendly people looking to make the world a better place. the mission statement gives your arm fuzzies when you think about it and the product breeds motivated individuals to support the brand and the mission. you will also find yourself matched side by side in the trenches with amazing peers who lift you up and will teach you amazing things and encourage you when you are down. cannot say the same about management.","there are too many cons to list. let us start with main ones.

you are just a number. the company grew too fast and if you do not get the special red carpet treatment because you know someone who knows someone, you will just get used, burned out, and never get recognized for what you have put in. i personally walked away but always walked away in 2022 when i was still making the same measly hourly wage they initially hired me in 2020 after doing everything the company asked for in return. i shifted my role to a trainer position, switched to a service center that was falling apart to keep it together, and everything you could ever ask for in an employee, i did it. i was promised and alluded a promotion but never got it until i threatened to walk out one day. that was the only time in my 3.5 year tenure i was promoted. sad right?

the lay off are crushing here and real. if you ever work for them, you realize that they like to ""change"" things up every so often. that could mean your hours change or your work environment changes. or they fire the last 5 people they hired in your department or they fire the most tenured employee that works the hardest because they get paid more than everyone else. it is a sad system in place run by a poorly hand plucked management and stems from an immature company with too much growth and not being able to handle it. they promote the wrong people, lay off the wrong people, and hire the wrong people leaving you with a disorganized chaos to constantly clean up since service is the step child of the company that ""should not"" technically exist. if the entire management team were more like the 4 managers i truly enjoyed my time with and supported 100% i would still be with the company. two were fired and two moved on to a different part of the company.

as service advisors, you are essentially just trying to keep the stock holders happy and fix the broken problems the engineering and factory created. toms of manufacturing defects, fitment issues, internal issues caused by trying to fix something else. if the root of the issues were fixed from the top down starting with strict engineering and quality control, 50% of the headaches would go away. instead service is dealing with either delaying the concern and putting bandaids on real issues that tesla has no answer to fix. there is a certain level of actually fixing things and being the punching bag of customers who are absolutely upset they are not treated like their previous mercedes service center but most of the time, we are informing the customers a future fix is coming or this is a known issue and our engineers are working on it. it gets old after a while and it seems to be the common trend with an immature company that cannot handle their growth properly.

long hours, zero recognition. with the revolving co-workers and managers, you truly are not valued as am employee. for the richest company in the world, we have the most sad company events and work gatherings. most of them are run by employees on their personal time and budget. work more for less. get more stuff done with less. and if someone does not do it, pick up the slack for them because eventually it will come back to you.

you also wonder how certain managers and co-workers got hired. it is astonishing how desperate the service department has gotten. if you pay more and are selective with your hiring process, maybe you can find the right people? the hourly thing for technicians can get old because they honestly have no incentive to work harder and faster unless internally motivated with $$$ like most automotive environments. 

management. internal greed and toxic culture. especially at a mecca center like tyson. this place breeds toxicity and i know there are are less intense and chill service centers out there. over time that toxicity will bleed through.",2

benefits i guess?","managers are so new, inexperienced, petty, controlling, territorial, micro-managerial, sarcastic, and non-understanding. stroke their egos and you will be okay i guess. this was made clear to me as they keep the people who talk and suck up, but do not actually do any work. these people are all “personality hires” who do not know how to do anything.

managers will cast doubt on you and never believe a word you say, especially in instances of requesting time off or going to the doctor, or working from home on the off occasion there is inclement weather, or personal issues. they would be easy on themselves when they had things come up and do whatever they wanted to do, but the same grace was never extended to people working under them.

rather than communicate if something is being done wrong, managers will use sarcasm and use sick mental games to put you down. i told my manager on multiple occasions that if i am doing something wrong, please tell me, but no….every one-on-one i was told everything is okay. until suddenly i was let go and given clearly made up reasons. 

the micromanagement was seriously confusing because one second i was told to check with my manager on everything and then the next i was told to “figure it out” and then if something went awry, they would then say “why did not you ask me?” these managers are hypocrites and racist. most shockingly, you will be ostracized if you have darker skin. there is no one on the architecture teams with dark skin. 

in performance acceleration, being told to speak up in meetings was encouraged, but i later found out from my own manager, that he hated when people shared their opinions in meetings. you know…if a leader asks for feedback or opinions in a meeting….do not just sit there in silence…..have a conversation about things……question things, riff off each other, inspire each other, be humble in your work……no culture of bringing each other up ….the managers just wanted to make themselves look good all the time. 

if you are offered a position in either the factory or studio architect / architecture departments…. one do not take it, there is a toxic work culture of sarcasm, distrust, and working 24/7. two, do not trust a single coworker, especially your managers. there are certain people who will try to destroy you, make you look bad at every step, and manipulate the situation to their advantage.

Tesla,Staff Engineer,0,frustrated with resources,"preamble: this review mainly applies to battery cell testing org. 

as a company, we definitely get stuff done for better or for worse. if upper management says we are going to do something, we are definitely doing it. some of those projects are actually very cool and inspiring, or downright fun. it is great to be an industry leader, not just in evs but also in li-ion batteries. tesla has accomplished unbelievable feats in a relatively small time, and it is exciting to be a part of it.

there are a lot of very smart people working here. generally, people are not jerks, or at least things have gotten better in that regard. it is a very accepting place (e.g. if you are lbgtq, or minority, or female) at least among lower and mid-level staff.","i have been at tesla a long time and i probably do not know anyone with 5+ years under their belt who is not either completely jaded, or else has completely drank the kool-aid. the dividing line arises roughly between manager/senior manager, or staff/senior staff. 

right below this dividing line there is a universal feeling of being unable to get adequate support (lab space, equipment, hires) to improve the status quo, because of a complete absence of mid-level employee empowerment, artificial scarcity, and executive hubris that we are all super smart and talented and can out-think any problem, never actually needing to scale up our test capabilities to handle said problems, (as doing so obviously would suggest we are not super smart.) 

i have seen countless staff-level employees quit over this, getting frustrated being stuck without anywhere to grow (especially if you are not a kool-aid drinker), being denied resources, but still kept on staff...why? 

""just in case"" we ever decide to start listening to those talented 5+ years experience phd staffers, i suppose? i have frequently thought about quitting over this same issue that caused so many of my former colleagues to quit.

management always paints a blue sky picture at every company meeting, getting very excited about the latest thing and long term growth prospects, but remains starkly untrusting of engineers who suggest anything's not going well, providing lip service suggesting you can simply come up and talk to them (director+ level with fully booked schedules at all times). but then when you do go up to this person, i have found no earnest intent for collaboration. 

they are quick to wave away your concern and do not promise any sort of resolution or path forward, even when you present them with a tangible and justified plan of action. in this way, management acts as if being frugal in the test lab is a perverse victory for the company rather than an enormous liability.

we have been shifting to more and more of a program management culture, scaling the number of cell programs, by several fold, and exponentially growing the cell supply, while scaling support to the core technology by a mere fraction of that.

in this new culture, program managers are responsible for task managing a lot of the ""old ways"" that were haphazardly established back when tesla actually did have resource scarcity. those old ways were wrought with false premises, but many engineers still demand running those same tests because (especially for newer employees) it is all they know, or (for old timers) they did speak up about it many times, but management would disingenuously tend to ask if there was any data to prove that a new proposed test would work to alleviate the problem, despite not actually helping to provide a pathway or resources to allow exploration of that very question. 

these grandfathered-in bare bones tests were arguably necessary for scaling the company in the early days, but should have only ever been attempted with the promise that eventually we would do things right once we had the resources. instead, we doubled down on these old ways, assuming they work great (even with evidence to the contrary) and we often cannot even adequately execute on that.",3

Tesla,Mechanical Engineer,0,engineers beware!,diverse project experience. exponential growth in experience due to work culture. power to make decisions early in your career. stepping stone to next job.,"gftx is unsafe and the company does not take ownership of this. you will be forced to work through safety issues in order to meet production milestones. i have seen the roof collapse, i have seen exhaust fans fall from 75 ft in the air, and i have also seen structural beams supporting a 150 metric ton crane “dropped” by contractors. no amount of ppe will protect you from these events if you are in the wrong place at the wrong time… promotion cycles are trash and require a major overhaul. the promotion matrix used by the company is extremely vague thus allowing for upper management to promote who they like. requirements are also not standardized so each individual engineer has a different goal line. also, need a village's approval to be promoted from p2 to p3 level. false promises and a revolving door of managers are standard operating procedure here. i had 4 different direct managers in the 2 years i was there. expect this change to occur every 6 months, you will also need to reprove yourself as an engineer each time. project timelines are intense and will require your full capabilities to cross the finish line with a less-than-perfect design. 85% of the work is completed by 15% of the workforce. you will be able to identify these individuals early on. if you cannot already tell from “real” reviews the turnover is extremely high at gftx. there is typically a 10% cut to the workforce every year. (i survived 2 of these major layoffs) and i would expect another 30% to leave every 12 months due to the nature of the job. your team will constantly be rushed in an attempt to balance the remaining workload from those who left. nepotism is also an issue at the office but i will let you figure that out when you get there. hr department is an absolute failure as well. their lack of action on subjects speaks volumes and expect zero help from them while there. overall, a lack of professionalism and respect toward engineers from upper management and other departments. ironically without us the building, assembly lines, and products would have never been designed. the stock is as volatile as a cryptocurrency and at any moment will rise and fall with elon’s mood. do not compromise your engineering ethics to please someone who sees you as another number. and finally, do not give a 2 weeks’ notice as you will be escorted offsite as soon as the company realizes you have another opportunity.",1

Tesla,Design Engineer,0,churn and burn mentality,opportunity to work at a breakneck pace with minimal bureaucracy. software and it services are optimized very well and help contribute to higher productivity. good resume building opportunity.,"the company culture filters down from the top. there is no regard for professional development, departmental culture, ethics, and morale. furthermore, in regards to ethics there is a strong encouragement (without being spoken aloud) to disregard occupational safety and hazards in the name of speed and hitting imaginary deadlines. extremely, extremely toxic. 

this company has a lot of dead weight. there is typically 5 people pointing their fingers for 1 person to execute. a lot of meeting schedulers and deadlines pushers with a very small workforce to execute. there are no metrics or kpi’s either, which make it very tough to see who is actually screwing up or providing value. the lack of kpi’s and performance metrics allows for full blown nepotism and favoritism when it comes to promotions. i hate saying this, but it is obvious that race plays a factor into performance reviews and promotions. plenty of evidence of this. this factory needs to do a full overhaul and strip down of the lopsided resources and dead weight throughout factory engineering. 

professional development is actively disregarded. if you want your manager to approve a training or engineering conference to go attend, good luck. it will not be approved. you are looked at as a short term asset. why invest any overhead in training the engineers. again, this is a company culture issue and can easily be addressed, but has not been addressed. 

partially why this probably has not been addressed is due to the constant turnover in leadership positions. they either get fired or quit due to all the distinction. this instability with leadership positions is crippling for making any sustainable improvements. 

finally, the office environment and parking is a total joke. be prepared for 40-50 minutes of riding on a bus everyday just to get to and from the office. the desks are literally shoulder to shoulder and it is so loud that you can barely hear yourself think. there is literally 2000 people sitting in a fully open floor office, so it is like the biggest telemarketing layout in the world. you have to wait in line to use the restroom. the food is insanely expensive (15$ per lunch), and there is no room in the shared refrigerators if you want to bring a lunch. if you want a dystopian office environment, this is your dream situation. use this job as a trampoline for better job opportunities. short term mindset. if you approach this job like that, then it is doable for a year or two.",2

needs, which might impact job security for some employees. health and safety concerns: working in manufacturing roles at tesla's production facilities can sometimes involve exposure to physical risks, which the company has been working to address and improve. cultural fit: tesla's work culture may not suit everyone. the high-energy, fast-paced, and sometimes unconventional approach might not align with the preferences and expectations of every employee. lack of clear structure: some employees might find the organization's structure less defined compared to more traditional companies, which could lead to challenges in terms of role clarity and reporting lines. stock price volatility: tesla's stock price can be volatile, which might affect stock-based compensation for employees. limited resources: depending on the department or project, employees might encounter constraints in terms of budget, staffing, or other resources. pressure to perform: the emphasis on innovation and continuous improvement might create a sense of pressure to constantly deliver exceptional results.",4

Tesla,Data Annotation Specialist,0,a graveyard for your career,"-some very good people. it is easy to make friends and good ones at that. people can make their own chat rooms while working and share memes and nonsense all day. 
-coffee and snacks. 
-pay is okay. however, you will gain little transferrable skills - if you look up positions like this you will see that it is often outsourced to places like india, so it is very hard to make a career out of this role and go places financially. 
-it is a cool thing to be a part of. in the future if cars can drive themselves, you will be able to say you were a part of that.","-this is not the luxurious, big tech, ping-pong in the break room kind of job you might be thinking of. this is a churn-and-burn digital sweat shop where you are treated like a number and that is the only thing that matters to higher management. you sit in a windowless office in a building that looks like a high school along with hundreds of coworkers that are just as miserable as you will be.
 -there is one driveway entrance to the entire building, so at the end of the work day all the hundreds of analysts leave at the same time, jamming the parking lot for upwards of 30 minutes every day. unless you sprint out the door first, expect to spend more of your day sitting at the factory unpaid in your car. 
-this would be the easiest job in the world to have remote/hybrid work be an option. on most days, you do not even have to talk to your lead or anyone else in person. they would rather have everyone crammed into an office and use hundreds of gallons of gas a day to get there. counterproductive for a company focused on sustainability. 
-upper management is the root of most problems here. favoritism runs rampant for promotions and policies are inconsistent depending on who is in charge of you. things like time off, disciplinary actions, etc. are handed out differently between supervisors. they break their own rules but do not seem to be held to the same standards as analysts due to the aforementioned favoritism. they also like to leave the office 10-15 mins early since they are salaried and do not need to wait to clock out and deal with the aforementioned parking lot issue. 
-every 6 months they have performance reviews that are just like getting your report cart in middle school. except in this instance, they do a mass firing of dozens of analysts that did not hit their arbitrary numbers in that period. be prepared to see several of your friends get called into a random meeting, never to be seen again, and hoping that you are not next. 
-downtime of any kind does not exist. they use software to track how long you have been staring at your computer screen on a daily basis, and if you do not hit their standard -- even due to bathroom breaks, emergency phone calls, burnout, etc. -- you will be disciplined. this also goes for attendance. if your car breaks down or you have a family emergency, you will still get attendance points on your record that can be used to fire you during those reviews mentioned above.",2

Tesla,UX Designer,0,devil wears prada work environment,- great to grow quickly as a designer - excellent for your resume - company bus / transit options - incredible medical benefits - high standards for design output - learn from the best of the best - design leadership supported you and did not allow product managers to majorly overstep or strong arm designers like you often see in tech. - design leadership has a very powerful influence and seat at the table which makes a huge difference vs other companies where they are 100% eng lead and could not care less about design. - top down design approval process so you do not have to deal with too many cooks in the kitchen. you know the exact people you need to get approval from and it is crystal clear when they like or do not like a design so you know where you stand - you do not have to deal with wishy washy managers who are afraid to be direct. you will have a ton of clarity working here.,- expect 60-80 hour work weeks as the norm even if you are a fast designer. - expect to work on holidays and weekends. - not a good fit if you have young kids or if you need to have your evenings free. - office was not very clean or well maintained. it felt very depressing to be there and the lighting feels like a sterile hospital. morale is low and there is no company culture compared to the other big tech companies. however the design is world class and you will learn invaluable skills as a designer and it will catapult your growth. - i had no social life when working here but i learned a ton. - expect to be ripped apart in a group setting in front of your peers if you mess up or if your design does not meet the standards of leadership. it is kind of like the devil wears prada movie.,2
Tesla,Production Associate,0,"great job potential, if you are the right person.","$20 an hour to do one repeated action for 12 hours a day for 4 days a week is honestly easy money. if you are the right person, of course. there are different jobs that they have different people do that have varying levels of difficulty. most people are super nice and tesla loves to reward its employees whenever large milestones are hit, celebrations with free food, shirt giveaways, etc. when you find the right people, it can honestly really start to feel like a second home. considering you would be working there for 12 hours a day for half of the month, meaning your essentially spending half of your life at this job , that is a very good thing!","12 hours a day. doing a repeated action for 4 days a week. if you are unfortunate enough to not have a vehicle to be able to get yourself to work then you must take the shuttles and they leave an hour and a half before work starts and leave about 30 minutes after work ends. so typically you would be getting up at 3:00 a.m. out of the door at 4:00 a.m. at work around 5:00 to 5:20 a.m. clock in at 6:00 out at 6:00. be on the bus 610 and be home by 7:00 p.m. that is around 15 hours that you are spending of your day for 4 days straight doing work stuff out of a 24-hour day. it is not to mention the aforementioned varying levels of difficulty with jobs on the floor. typically you are assigned to do one thing a day and they say it is supposed to rotate to keep everyone fair, but unfortunately that is not the case. people who are favorited by certain line leads or supervisors get easier and dare i say even funner jobs. yes, there are certain jobs that are actually fun. but unfortunately, if you are not one of these people, then you will be floating around or have a spot that they like you at if you are either good at the job or if you are bad at everything else. that is understandable. what i do not understand is how certain jobs seem to be tied to race and demographic. unfortunately as an african american, i was stuck doing the hardest job. i ended up getting tendonitis in both of my wrists from this job and they still continue to put me there even while having a wrist brace on, and it seems that they only like to put people who were of darker melanin or people who frequently because problems back there. i personally was not a problem causer i never got into any arguments nor that i complain about my job outside of my physical injuries, and neither did many of my co-workers. most of the people that i worked with generally really cool safe for a handful of people every once in a while who would get sent back there because they could not get along with people at their station. but for some reason everyone back there was always black and i honestly rarely saw black people at any other station. this is an epidemic that not only i, but many of my co-workers have noticed, pointed out and discussed. with that aside, another con that i can list is the work life balance. you do not get nearly enough time in your day on the work week to be able to get everything that you need done to be prepared fully for the next day of work. you get home at 7:00 p.m. and have to wake up at 3:00 a.m. and you somehow have to find the time to cook and eat and shower and get an adequate amount of sleep then. and if you or someone like me who is forced every single day to do a very difficult and taxing job that does not allow for breaks, you will find it hard to be able to not just plop on your bed and go to sleep without having the tiniest bit of energy to even be able to take a shower or eat. not only that, but you only get 30 and 315 minute breaks very broken up throughout the day at a 12-hour work shift. that is completely disproportionate. your first set of breaks allocates to 6 hours of work, with 15 minutes of break. total. and with a job that i was doing you are going to need a lot more than just 15 minutes every 6 hours and then a 30 minute break for lunch.",3

everyone is very young, ambitious, and sometimes it feels competitive. this is fine, but a lot of people cannot handle the pressure so they describe it as an unfriendly environment when in reality its very friendly. extroverted engineers do very well here.
